### Brian Riedinger

## A Little Bit About Me ðŸ‘‹
I enjoy creating web applications as a software engineer. I have years of expertise as a **front-end developer** and I currently oversee a team as an **engineering manager**.

I supervise a group of developers as a lead and serve as the product owner for a certain product line. I create the product roadmap to meet the needs of our clients and manage a team that designs, develops, produces, and maintains a set of apps.

I stay involved and contribute technically to the foundation of the program. I work on adding new features, addressing bugs, testing, and mentoring while also assisting in the creation and communication of software ideas.
