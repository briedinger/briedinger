### Brian Riedinger

## A Little Bit About Me ðŸ‘‹
I'm a **front end developer** and a **software engineering manager**.

I enjoy designing and creating usable products for the web. I have extensive experience taking part in every stage of product development -- from user experience design, to software design, development, and maintenance. I have also supervized a full-stack team and served as their **product owner**, where I grew the user base by creating and realizing the application roadmap.

No matter my job function, I stay involved and contribute technically to the foundation of the program. I work on adding new features, addressing bugs, testing, and mentoring while also assisting in the creation and communication of software ideas.

## What I'm Currently Learning
I'm working on modernizing a large, complex baseline from aging technologies to *Svelte**, native **Javascript** & *CSS* language features. Additionally, I'm exploring technologies such as Tailwind, Vite, and file system-based routing utilities.

Then there's **user experience design**. I greatly admire the pros so I enjoy learning and practicing it myself in hopes to grow that skill on my own.
