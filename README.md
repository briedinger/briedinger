### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there!

I love creating web applications as a software engineer. Even though I have years of expertise as a front-end developer, I currently serve as an engineering manager, using my experience to oversee a team.

I supervise a group of developers as a lead and serve as the product owner for a certain product line. I create the product roadmap to meet the needs of our clients and manage a team that designs, develops, produces, and maintains a set of apps.

I stay involved and contribute technically to the foundation of the program. I work on adding new features, addressing bugs, testing, and mentoring while also assisting in the creation and communication of software ideas.
