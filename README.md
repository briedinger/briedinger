### Brian Riedinger

## A Little Bit About Me ðŸ‘‹
I'm a **front end developer** and a **software lead**.

My passion is designing and developing usable products for the web. As a developer, I participate in all phases of the product development process -- design, creation, maintenance, and user support of a production software tool suite. As a lead, I oversee the develeopment process and monitor goals for a full-stack team, where I have been able to boost user adoption by developing and implementing the application roadmap.

No matter my job function, I stay involved and contribute technically to the foundation of the program. I work on adding new features, tech insertion, addressing bugs, testing, and mentoring while also assisting in the creation and communication of software ideas.

## What I'm Currently Learning ðŸŒ±
I'm working on modernizing a large, complex baseline from aging technologies to using modern solutions, like **Svelte**, native **Javascript** & **CSS** language features. Additionally, I'm exploring technologies such as Tailwind, Vite, and file system-based routing utilities.

I moonlight doing **user experience design**. I greatly admire the pros so I enjoy learning and practicing it myself in hopes to grow that skill on my own.

## Fun Facts ðŸ’¬
I love foosball and I'm pretty good at it.
I play soccer myself -- the kind with real people on grass, not a table. I'm less good at it.
My kids keep me active playing basketball, volleyball, and experiencing Colorado by camping, hiking, biking, and snowboarding.
